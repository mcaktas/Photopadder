📸 PhotoPadder

A simple, photographer-friendly tool for preparing print-ready, photobook-ready, and gallery-ready images — without ever resizing or cropping your photo.

Pad to preset ratios: 2:3, 4:5, 1:1

Even mode (add border only, keep original ratio untouched)

Custom ratio support (e.g. 3:7, 16:9, 5:4)

Fully configurable border color with color picker

Overwrite protection (asks before replacing existing files)

Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

Designed specifically for photographers who export from Lightroom and want a clean, consistent aspect ratio or border for prints or photobooks.
